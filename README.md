# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! Here, I upload solutions to the problems I practice daily on LeetCode. Each solution includes a detailed explanation of the approach used, and I aim to provide implementations in multiple programming languages, starting with C++ and Python.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by difficulty level, with each difficulty level containing folders for individual problems. Each problem folder includes:

- **Problem statement**
- **Approach/Explanation**
- **Solutions in C++ and Python (more languages coming soon)**

### Folder Structure

- **Easy/**
  - Problem 1/
    - `README.md` (Problem statement and approach)
    - `solution.cpp` (C++ solution)
    - `solution.py` (Python solution)
  - Problem 2/
    - ...
- **Medium/**
  - Problem 1/
    - ...
- **Hard/**
  - Problem 1/
    - ...

## How to Navigate

- **Easy**: Contains solutions to easy problems.
- **Medium**: Contains solutions to medium-level problems.
- **Hard**: Contains solutions to hard problems.

Each problem folder is named with the problem number and a short description, e.g., `1_Two_Sum`.

## Languages

Currently supported languages:
- C++
- Python

Coming soon:
- Java
- JavaScript
- Go
- Others

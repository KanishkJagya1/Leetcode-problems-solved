BRUTE FORCE APPROACH

Algorithm
Initialize totalWays to 0 to track the number of ways to reach the target sum.

Call calculateWays with the initial parameters: nums, currentIndex = 0, currentSum = 0, target, to start the recursive process.

In the calculateWays function:

If currentIndex equals the length of nums:
Check if currentSum matches target:
If yes, increment totalWays by 1 (a valid way to reach the target sum).
Otherwise:
Include the number at currentIndex with a positive sign:
Recursively call calculateWays with currentIndex + 1 and currentSum + nums[currentIndex].
Include the current number at currentIndex with a negative sign:
Recursively call calculateWays with currentIndex + 1 and currentSum - nums[currentIndex].
Return totalWays after all recursive calls, representing the total number of ways to assign signs to reach the target sum.
